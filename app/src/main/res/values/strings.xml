    <string name="title_activity_guidance_soothing_main">Why is my baby crying?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_intro">Usually there’s a reason because of which baby is crying. Remember, when something is bothering your baby, your baby doesn’t have any way to communicate besides crying.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_1">Dirty diaper?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_detail_1">Ckech wether the diaper needs to be changed or adjusted?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_2">Needs to burp?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_detail_2">Try the different positions outlined in the burping section.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_3">Gas?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_detail_3">Try laying your baby on her back and then moving her legs and hips up and down like she’s riding a bicycle.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_4">Physical discomfort?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_detail_4">Is the baby too hot or cold? Is there something on the baby that’s too tight or scratchy.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_5">Lonely?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_detail_5">If she wakes up and no one is around, she might cry out for some company and just want to be held.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_6">Hungry?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_detail_6">Hand her over to mom for some feeding.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_7">Fever?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_detail_7">An easy-to-use forehead thermometer is a must for when you have a baby. If the reading says she’s running a temperature, you can give her some acetaminophen. Be sure to check with you doctor for the right dosage.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_8">Need sleep?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_detail_8">Check whether the baby is sleepy? If so, make proper arrangements for the baby to sleep.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_9">Too much stimulus?</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_cause_detail_9">Some babies can be unusually sensitive to touch, light, or sound, and might startle and cry easily, sleep less than expected. If that\'s the case with your baby, keep noise and light levels low to moderate.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_intro">Here are some potential soothers</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_1">Pacifier</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_detail_1">Not all babies take to the pacifier, and there are pros and cons to using one, but they can definitely work wonders for some baby. Remove the pacifier once baby sleep.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_2">Put the baby in a motorized swing</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_detail_2">Can work in some baby.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_3">Swaddle</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_detail_3">Babies like being tightly wrapped - it reminds them of being back in the womb. Swaddling a baby using a blanket is pretty simple. Don’t try this in baby more than three months. Proper swaddling keeps a baby\'s arms close to the body while allowing for some movement of the legs. Not only does swaddling keep a baby warm, but it seems to give most newborns a sense of security and comfort. Swaddling also may help limit the startle reflex, which can wake a baby.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_4">Run the vacuum</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_detail_4">The womb was a surprisingly loud place, so replicating that kind of noise can put your baby at ease. Running your vacuum next to them can be amazingly effective.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_5">Vocal sounds and music</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_detail_5">Babies usually love vocal sounds, such as talking, babbling, singing, and cooing. Your baby will probably also love listening to music. Baby rattles and musical mobiles are other good ways to stimulate your infant\'s hearing. If your little one is being fussy, try singing, reciting poetry and nursery rhymes, or reading aloud as you sway or rock your baby gently in a chair.</string>
    <string name="guidance_soothing_remedies_warning">If above remedies don’t work and baby continue to cry without any cause; consult your doctor. Remember inconsolable cry can be a danger sign and need evaluation from doctor</string>
    <string name="hand_wash_guide_11">Your hands are now safe</string>
    <string name="hand_wash_guide_10">Use towel to turn of faucet</string>
    <string name="hand_wash_guide_9">Dry hand thoroughly with a single use towel</string>

    <string name="wash_hands_header_text_3">40 - 60 Seconds</string>
    <string name="guidance_swadle_header">Carefully follow the following guidelines to swaddle your baby</string>
    <string name="guidance_swadle_text_1">Spread out the receiving blanket, with one corner folded over slightly.</string>
    <string name="guidance_swadle_text_2">Lay the baby face-up on the blanket with his or her head above the folded corner.</string>
    <string name="guidance_swadle_text_3">Bring the bottom corner up over the baby\'s feet and pull it toward the head, folding the fabric down if it gets close to the face. Be sure not to wrap too tightly around the hips. Hips and knees should be slightly bent and turned out. Wrapping your baby too tightly may increase the chance of hip dysplasia.</string>
    <string name="guidance_swadle_text_4">Wrap the right corner around the baby, and tuck it under the baby\'s back on the left side, leaving only the neck and head exposed.</string>
    <string name="guidance_swadle_text_5">To make sure your baby is not wrapped too tight, make sure you can slip a hand between the blanket and your baby\'s chest, which will allow comfortable breathing. Make sure, however, that the blanket is not so loose that it could become undone.</string>
    <string name="guidance_swadle_text_6_warning">Babies should not be swaddled after they\'re 2 months old. At this age, some babies can roll over while swaddled, which increases their risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).</string>

	<li><strong><font size="4">Newborn actually sleeps</strong><strong> about 16 hours or more!</font></strong> Don&#39;t expect yours to sleep through the night &mdash; the digestive system of babies is so small that they need nourishment every few hours and should be awakened if they haven&#39;t been fed for 4 hours (or more frequently if your doctor is concerned about weight gain). </li>
	<br>
	<li><strong><font size="4">Use a crib.</font></strong> A crib should be easily assessable to mother (rooming in). Few centers also recommend bedding in (mother and baby in same bed). This helps to develop bonding, lactation and also help to keep baby warm. Before mother sleep baby should be kept in crib. </li>
		<br>
	<li><strong><font size="4">It&#39;s important to place babies on their backs to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome).</font></strong> In addition, remove all fluffy bedding, pillows and soft toys from the crib to ensure that your baby doesn&#39;t get tangled in them or suffocate. Also be sure to alternate the position of your baby&#39;s head from night to night (first right, then left, and so on) to prevent the development of a flat spot on one side of the head.</li>
			<br>
	<li><strong><font size="4">When can you expect your baby to sleep through the night?</font></strong> &nbsp; Many babies sleep through the night (between 6-8 hours) at 3 months of age, but if yours doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s not a cause for concern. Like adults, babies must develop their own sleep patterns and cycles.</li>
		<br>
	<li><strong><font size="4">Many newborns have tend to be more awake and alert at night, and more sleepy during the day.</font></strong> One way to help them is to keep the stimulation at night to a minimum. Keep the lights low, such as by using a nightlight. When your baby wakes up during the day try to keep him or her awake a little longer by talking and playing.</li>

Latch a baby in a way that breast do not cover the nose. Maximum black portion of nipple should be inside baby\'s mouth. Let baby empty one breast at a time to ensure both hind milk and fore milk. Burp the baby properly after each feed. This reduces vomiting and evening irritability due to swallowed air during feeding. After burping let baby rest on right lateral position for few minutes followed by rest lying on back. Always breastfeed baby during night, it helps to increase amount of milk as oxytocin reflex is strong during night. Talk to baby while feeding, look into baby\'s eyes interact with him. Don\'t read or watch TV while feeding baby. Love for baby increases breast milk<strong>. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Breastfeeding should continue for 1 1/2 - 2 yrs.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Feeding Frequency</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The first few days, feedings may last about 10 minutes on each breast. Later, feedings will last about 10 to 20 minutes on each breast</li>
	<li>Feedings may be 1 1/2 - to 3 hours apart the first few weeks. Time between feedings lengthen to 3 or 4 hours</li>

	<li>Hind Milk - milk secreted after fore milk is over. This hind-milk has a higher fat and calories, helps in weight gain. Gives satiety (baby sleeps for adequate time before next feed)</li>

        <p>Whichever you use cloth or disposable diapers, baby mostly dirty diapers about 10 times a day, or about 70 times a week.</p>
        <p>Before diapering your baby, make sure you have all supplies within reach so you won\'t have to leave your infant unattended on the changing table.</p>
        <p>You\'ll need:
        <ul>
        <li>a clean diaper</li>
        <li>diaper ointment if the baby has a rash</li>
        <li>a container of warm water</li>
		<li>clean washcloth, diaper wipes, or cotton balls</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After each bowel movement or if the diaper is wet, lay your baby on his or her back and remove the dirty diaper. Use the water, cotton balls, and washcloth or the wipes to gently wipe your baby\'s genital area clean. When wiping a girl, wipe her bottom from front to back to avoid a urinary tract infection. To prevent or heal a rash, apply ointment. Always remember to wash your hands thoroughly after changing a diaper.</p>
		<p>To prevent or heal diaper rash,
		<ul>
        <li>Change your baby\'s diaper frequently, and as soon as possible after bowel movements.</li>
        <li>After cleaning the area, apply a diaper rash or "barrier" cream. Creams with zinc oxide are preferred because they form a barrier against moisture.</li>
        <li>If you use cloth diapers, wash them in dye- and fragrance-free detergents.</li>
		<li>Let the baby go undiapered for part of the day. This gives the skin a chance to air out.</li>
        </ul>
		<p>If the diaper rash continues for more than 3 days or seems to be getting worse, call your doctor &mdash; it may be caused by a fungal infection that requires a prescription.</p>

    <string name="formula_main_text"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Advice especially for the working mothers</strong></p>

<p>Your baby can still receive the benefits of breast milk even if you go out to work. Partial breast-feeding is better than bottle-feeding completely, so continue to breast-feed even after you have been advised to give other foods. If you sleep with your baby, he will breast-feed during the night without disturbing you. Before you leave home in the morning and again when you return, breast-feed your baby. When mixed feeding, always offer the breast before giving other foods.</p>

<p><em>Remember: Breast milk is the best and most economical food for your baby.</em></p>

<p><strong>Seek advice</strong></p>

<p>The use of foods which are not intended for young babies can be harmful. Unnecessary introduction of partial bottle-feeding or other foods and drinks will have a negative effect on breast-feeding. Therefore always consult a health professional before introducing anything other than breast milk.</p>

<p><strong>Using a breast-milk substitute</strong></p>

<p>If a doctor or another health professional recommends an addition to breast-feeding, or its replacement, during the first 6 months of life, it is preferable to use an infant formula meeting recognized quality standards.</p>

<p>When used correctly this supplies the nutritional needs of your baby. You will need more than one can (450g) per week if your baby is only bottle-fed, so keep your family circumstances and costs in mind before deciding whether to use infant formula.</p>

<p>As soon as your baby is old enough, feed infant formula with a cup and spoon</p>

<p><strong>Important notice: </strong>Breast milk is best for babies.</p>

<p>Before you decide to use an Infant Formula, consult your health professional for advice.</p>

<p><strong>Warning: </strong>Unboiled water, unboiled bottles or incorrect dilution can make your baby ill. Incorrect storage, handling, preparation and feeding can potentially lead to adverse effects for the health of your baby.</p>

<p><strong>Warning: </strong>Only prepare one bottle at a time. Feed immediately and follow the instructions exactly. Do not keep unfinished bottle, discard the contents. Always hold baby while feeding. Leaving baby unattended may cause choking.</p> ]]>

Partial breast-feeding is better than bottle-feeding completely, so continue to breast-feed even after you have been advised to give other foods. If you sleep with your baby, he will breast-feed during the night without disturbing you. Before you leave home in the morning and again when you return, breast-feed your baby.

	<li><strong>Using a breast-milk substitute</strong> If a doctor or another health professional recommends an addition to breast-feeding, or its replacement, during the first 6 months of life, it is preferable to use an infant formula meeting recognized quality standards.
When used correctly this supplies the nutritional needs of your baby. You will need more than one can (450g) per week if your baby is only bottle-fed, so keep your family circumstances and costs in mind before deciding whether to use infant formula.
As soon as your baby is old enough, feed infant formula with a cup and spoon

        <p>Immediately after circumcision ,the tip of the penis is usually covered with gauze coated with petroleum jelly to keep the wound from sticking to the diaper. Gently wipe the tip clean with warm water after a diaper change, then apply petroleum jelly to the tip so it doesn\'t stick to the diaper. Redness or irritation of the penis should heal within a few days, but if the redness or swelling increases or if pus-filled blisters form, infection may be present and you should call your baby\'s doctor immediately.</p>
        <p>Umbilical cord care in newborns is also important. Some doctors suggest swabbing the area with rubbing alcohol until the cord stump dries up and falls off, usually in 10 days to 3 weeks, but others recommend leaving the area alone. Talk to your child\'s doctor to see what he or she prefers.</p>
        <p>An infant\'s navel area shouldn\'t be submerged in water until the cord stump falls off and the area is healed. Until it falls off, the cord stump will change color from yellow to brown or black &mdash; this is normal. Consult your doctor if the navel area becomes reddened or if a foul odor or discharge develops.</p>
